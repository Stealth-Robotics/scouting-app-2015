Please do change where/how the error message is done. I didn't look at the code very much, so I just put it where the crash happened.

This isn't complete yet. At all. Error message handling is done when I have a working build and functionality is complete. The IO app is using MVVM, so much of the functionality is linked together. If the functionality needed is not complete yet (for example, matches depending on teams), it will crash.

Sean your commit just deleted my entire NewEventDlg.xaml file. Now I have to create that from scratch again. Don't commit here unless you know what you're doing. If you want to point out an issue, use the issue tracker built in to Github. Don't try to fix it if you don't know how everything fits together.
